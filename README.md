    working-dir: "." # override working dir to run the command here
```

- Yarn Install - install deps and cache using Yarn Cache action

```yaml
- uses: vtno/seei/.github/actions/yarn-install@main
  with:
    node-version: "16" # override the default version here
    working-dir: "." # override working dir to run the command here
```

- Yarn Build - build with cached deps

```yaml
- uses: vtno/seei/.github/actions/yarn-build@main
  with:
    node-version: "16" # override the default version here
    working-dir: "." # override working dir to run the command here
```

- Yarn Test - test with cached deps

```yaml
- uses: vtno/seei/.github/actions/yarn-test@main
